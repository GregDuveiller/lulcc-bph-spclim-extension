The dataset of [@Duveiller2018] provides a spatialized estimation of the potential effect of vegetation cover change for a series of variables.
Due to the methodology, this estimation can only be provided where the target and source vegetation cover types co-exist within a local moving window, thereby resulting in a limite of the global spatial extent for which the information can be provided.

The data has the same format, but now contains an extra variable, which is spatially extended using ML.
